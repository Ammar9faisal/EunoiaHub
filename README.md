## Installation

To get started with the EunoiaHub, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Ammar9faisal/EunoiaHub.git
    cd <your root directory>
    ```


2. **Install dependencies:**

    Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

    ```env
    VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://your-appwrite-endpoint
    VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-appwrite-project-id
    VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your-appwrite-database-id
    VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID_USERS=your-users-collection-id
    VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID_SURVEYRESPONSES=your-survey-responses-collection-id
    VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID_TODOLISTS=your-todo-lists-collection-id
    VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID_VISIONBOARDS=your-vision-boards-collection-id
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
    VITE_USE_STUB_DATABASE=false
    ```
    For the sake of the our course demo for ease of access, all the non-billed API keys have been made available in the `.env` folder already. The only
    excluded API key is Google Maps API which is billed. However, you can learn how to generate your own by reading our wiki.

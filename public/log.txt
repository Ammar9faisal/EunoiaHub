RATIONALE BEHIND CHANGES ON THE PLAN AND BIG DECISION CHANGES
- APP NAME : We changed it from Wellness App to Eunoia Hub as it sounded more inviting and interesting

- CHNAGING THE TARGET CUSTOMER - we changed the app to be made for just students and people who spend most of their time 
working on their laptop/desktop.

- CHANGING FROM MOBILE APP TO WEB APP - since the app is just going to be focused on a specific user base, i only made sense
for us to change it to a web app. It was also easier for us to work on a web application as the team did not have any experience
for a mobile app

- ADDING CHATBOT TO ITR0 - CHATBOT was supposed to be a part of iteration 3 but was moved to be done earlier as it was one of
the main features that a user can have access to early on into the development.

- REMOVING COLOR CODING AS PART OF ITR1 - Color coding was supposed to differentiate users based on the survey but coding it 
created a lot of errors. Since it was not something that would change or effect the entire process of the app too much, we 
decided to keep it as an added feature with low priority

- ADDING TO DO LIST AS PART OF ITR 1 - To do list was something out client also emphasized in the client meeting, so it was
something we wanted to add early on the project deliverable.

- CHANGING USER STORY IN ITR 3 AS PER CLIENT REQUEST - As per the client request we changed two user stories (color coded, goal setting)
for ITR 3 with Message in a bottle and Bubble Burst Game
